<h2>Chef John's French Fries</h2>
<p>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method. I don't think most people realize
    that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens
    the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.
    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil
        and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer
        potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
    <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden
        brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
